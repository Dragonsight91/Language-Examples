# CLI Calculator C# Edition V1

### Requirements

This project was built in Visual Studio 2019 (Version 16.8.4) using .NET 5. The application should be compilable and runnable on all .NET 5 compatible OSes and the only requirement to build the code should be .net 5.

Windows Instructions:
- Install Visual Studio Community Edition 2019 (or later, if you are in the future)
- Install .NET 5 SDK (this may not be required with newer versions of Visual Studio)
- Open .sln file
- Run!

Linux Instructions
- No idea as I don't use Linux but I'm sure it's something to do with VS Code and .NET 5. This blog post contains some hints on how to run on Linux https://www.michalbialecki.com/2020/06/08/net-5-how-to-start/#:~:text=NET%205%20not%20only%20on,dotnet%20new%20console%20%2Dn%20ConsoleApp2%20.
